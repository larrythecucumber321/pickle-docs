# How to get PICKLE

#### Farms

One of the easiest ways to get pickles is to participate in our farms. As mentioned above, farms are eligible to receive emissions of new PICKLE tokens to enhance the APY of their investments. This also positions users directly in front of the emissions spigot without having to deal with any exchangesâ€”centralized or decentralized.&#x20;



#### Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized exchanges such as SushiSwap, UniSwap, and 1inch are great ways to purchase PICKLE. All of these exchanges maintain or interact with existing liquidity pools. Purchases made from these pools can sometimes be at a discount (or premium) to the market price on centralized exchanges.&#x20;

Because these services often trade many tokens, and because anyone can create a token with the same name, you should always verify that you are trading the correct token with the correct contract address. Before confirming your transaction, always verify the PICKLE token smart contract address:[ 0x429881672b9ae42b8eba0e26cd9c73711b891ca5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x429881672B9AE42b8EbA0E26cD9C73711b891Ca5)\
