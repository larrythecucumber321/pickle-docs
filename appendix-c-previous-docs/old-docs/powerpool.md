Want to maximize your PICKLE rewards? Look no further.

The PICKLE/ETH 50:50 Uniswap pool is the primary source of liquidity for PICKLE tokens.

### Farming PICKLE

Farming PICKLE tokens by supplying liquidity to the PICKLE/ETH pool consists of 2 steps:

1. Supplying ETH and PICKLE tokens on Uniswap
2. Staking the Uniswap Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens from Step 1 in the Pickle Power farm [here](https://app.pickle.finance/farms)

**IMPORTANT: You will only earn PICKLE rewards once both steps are completed.**

## **Adding Liquidity**

### Option 1 - Zapper.fi Integration

&#x20;Zapper.fi users can add liquidity to the PICKLE/ETH pool by doing the following:

1. Click on the **INVEST** tab
2. Search for **PICKLE**
3. Click on **ADD LIQUIDITY**

### Option 2 - Adding Liquidity on Uniswap

In order to add liquidity on Uniswap, you will first need PICKLEs and ETH in equal quantities.

You can trade ETH for PICKLE tokens [here](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x429881672b9ae42b8eba0e26cd9c73711b891ca5\&outputCurrency=ETH).&#x20;

Before confirming any transactions, always verify the PICKLE token smart contract address: **0x429881672b9ae42b8eba0e26cd9c73711b891ca5**

Once you have obtained ETH and PICKLE tokens in a 50:50 ratio, proceed to the Uniswap pool [here](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x429881672b9ae42b8eba0e26cd9c73711b891ca5/ETH).

Enter the amount of ETH or PICKLE that you would like to supply, and Uniswap will automatically populate the corresponding amount of the other token to ensure a 50:50 ratio. Click **SUPPLY** to add liquidity.

_Please note that you will have to approve spending limits for your ETH and PICKLE tokens when you do this for the first time._

### Staking LP tokens for PICKLE rewards

Once you supply tokens to Uniswap, you will receive UNI V2 LP tokens representing your share of the PICKLE/ETH pool. Head over to the Pickle Power farm [here](https://app.pickle.finance/farms).

If you have followed the instructions correctly, your UNI V2 token balance should appear where highlighted above. Stake your LP tokens and confirm the transaction.&#x20;

_Please note that you will have to approve a spending limit for your LP tokens when you do this for the first time._
