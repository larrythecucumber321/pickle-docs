## Modifying a DILL lock

If you have any DILL locked, the website will enable you to 1) increase your lock amount and/or 2) extend your lock.

* **Increase Lock Amount**. Clicking here adds PICKLEs to your existing lock by the amount you input. Your _Balance_ is the amount of unlocked PICKLEs on your wallet
* **Extend Lock Time**. You may click on the input field and use the calendar tool to select a date, which will be rounded to the nearest DILL epoch (lasting a week). You may also use the radio buttons to select an extension period

You will be prompted to confirm a transaction from your MetaMask/Web3 wallet for either of the above actions (they are separate transactions).&#x20;
