# Farm with your pTokens

Once you have received pTokens from depositing assets in the PickleJars (guide [here](lock-pickles/pickle-jars.md)), then you are ready to stake your pTokens in the Farms for PICKLE rewards.

**Step 1:**

Navigate to [https://app.pickle.finance/farms](https://app.pickle.finance/farms)

#### Step 2:

Select the Farm you wish to stake in. You should select the Farm with the same “p” token that you already own.

#### Step 3:

Enter your desired stake amount and click “Approve and Stake”

A transaction will pop-up for you to sign to “Approve” this transaction.&#x20;

After the transaction is complete, another transaction will pop up for you to sign to “Stake” the tokens.

#### Step 4:

Congratulations, you have successfully staked your pTokens in a Farm. This means your tokens are earning PICKLEs in addition to yields from the Pickle Jar.
