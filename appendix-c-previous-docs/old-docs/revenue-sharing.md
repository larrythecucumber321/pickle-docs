# Revenue Sharing

**45% of the protocol's revenues** (gross income) is distributed weekly in market-bought PICKLEs. The amount that a user is entitled to is determined by their proportional share of the total DILL supply multiplied by the number of PICKLEs that are distributed weekly. &#x20;

Users can claim their weekly rewards at [https://app.pickle.finance/dill](https://app.pickle.finance/dill).

The first distribution will be made on **April 29, 2021**.&#x20;
