# pJar 0.00

### **What is pJar 0.00?**&#x20;

pJar 0.00 is Pickle Finance's first set of pJars which involves a user depositing one of the LP tokens received from supplying liquidity on [Curve.Fi](http://curve.fi/). Pickle Finance currently accepts three different Curve deposit tokens:

| Deposit Token/pJar                                 | How to Obtain                                                                             | Returned Token | Current Strategy                                                                                  |

Essentially, by depositing \[x]CRV with Pickle Finance, you will receive **p\[x]CRV** tokens in return.

Using the deposited \[x]CRV, pJar 0.0 earns and re-invests CRV rewards and SNX/LDO rewards for the sCRV Jar for you so that you end up having \[x]CRV than you started out with.

### Earning PICKLEs from the Farm

With the exception of psCRV, the p\[x]CRV tokens will allow you to additionally earn PICKLE rewards by depositing them in the [Farm](https://app.pickle.finance/farms).

### Future plans

Pickle Finance is waiting for approval to be whitelisted on Curve. This will allow boost CRV rewards by up to 2.5 times by locking up a number of CRV tokens.
