# Farm Weights

### What are Farm weights?

Simply put, a Farm weight translates into how much of the PICKLE emissions a particular Farm receives. The below image illustrates an example distribution of weights.

### When do Farm weights change?

Farm weights are updated weekly on Thursdays at midnight UTC. Users' most recent weighting votes will take effect at that time.&#x20;

### **Who can vote for gauge weights?**

Users who have locked their PICKLEs for DILL will be able to vote on how they would like their vote weight to be distributed across one or more Farms. The weights ultimately applied to the various Farms depend on the allocation and DILL balance of the users who vote.

Users can cast their votes here [https://app.pickle.finance/farms](https://app.pickle.finance/farms). A guide on how to do so is [here](lock-pickles/farm-weight-voting.md).
