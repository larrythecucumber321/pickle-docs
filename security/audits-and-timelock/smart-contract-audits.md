### MixBytes Audit

An audit of the full suite of Pickle Finance smart contracts by[ MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/) commenced on October 3, 2020.

To date, all of the PickleJar strategy contracts created in 2020 have been audited.&#x20;

No critical or major issues were found in the strategy contracts. Minor issues have been fixed. The audit report warned of suspicious proxy functions (which the Pickle Finance developers explained were necessary and were protected by a 12 hour timelock).

An audit of the remaining contracts is underway and is expected to complete shortly.
