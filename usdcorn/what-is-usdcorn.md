# What is $CORN?

$CORN (also known as the ['Cornichon' token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa456b515303b2ce344e9d2601f91270f8c2fea5e)) was created by the team as a debt token after Pickle Finance was hit by the [Evil Jar hack](https://github.com/banteg/evil-jar), costing users 19,759,355 DAI.

#### How are $CORN holders being compensated for their losses?

Today, 5% of all weekly revenues are allocated to buying back and burning $CORN at the current market price.

Purchases are made against the DAI-CORNICHON liquidity pool on Uniswap. [This chart](https://dune.com/embeds/15984/32164/a03bdd45-9051-47b5-be80-26d91799bd40) shows how many tokens remain to be repurchased and burned.

$CORN will continue to be be subjected to a plan of buyback-and-burn, followed by direct redemption, until completely retired.
