# Where does Pickle Finance operate?

### What chains do Pickle Finance operate on?

Pickle Finance was launched on the Ethereum MainNet network. Like most projects launched during the “Summer of DeFi” in the Summer of 2020, Pickle was limited to farming other DeFi protocols, and had to operate where those protocols lived. That place was the Ethereum network.&#x20;

Today, many lower-level protocols have expanded to many different networks and Yield Farmers have followed them. Pickle Finance has expanded onto these networks namely Polygon, Arbitrum, Okex, Cronos, Gnosis Moonriver, Aurora, Metis, Moonbeam, Optimism and Fantom. We will continue to expand to other networks and L2s that we believe they provide the best yield Jars for our users.\
