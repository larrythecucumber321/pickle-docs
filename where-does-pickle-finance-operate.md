# Where does Pickle Finance operate?



* Pickle Finance operates on Ethereum MainNet and Polygon (Matic) Network

Pickle Finance was launched on the Ethereum MainNet network. Like most projects launched during the “Summer of DeFi” in the Summer of 2020, Pickle was limited to farming other DeFi protocols, and had to operate where those protocols lived. That place was the Ethereum network.&#x20;

Today, many lower-level protocols have expanded to the Polygon (matic) Network, and Yield Farmers have followed them. Pickle Finance expanded onto the Polygon network once the demand for services there made such a move feasible.
