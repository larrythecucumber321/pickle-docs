### Current Strategies <a href="#docs-internal-guid-fa289678-7fff-aa68-2919-631dbdfd4b86" id="docs-internal-guid-fa289678-7fff-aa68-2919-631dbdfd4b86"></a>

A full list of pickle jars can be found at[ https://app.pickle.finance/jars](https://app.pickle.finance/jars). This list of jars will change depending on which network you are connected to (Ethereum Mainnet vs Polygon)

Each PickleJar employs a Strategy contract to earn yield for its depositors. In these documents, we explore the types of Strategies being employed and how these work under the hood.

All Strategy contracts are being developed under the [src/strategies](https://github.com/pickle-finance/protocol/tree/master/src/strategies) directory of the protocol repository. For a listing of all currently deployed Strategy contracts, see the [contracts repository](https://github.com/pickle-finance/contracts).
