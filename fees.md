# Fees

* Pickle takes 20% of the rewards token being compounded as a fee, in most cases.&#x20;
* Some Jars have custom fee schedules, with a percentage of AUM taken throughout a year.

For Ethereum, Arbitrum and Polygon Jars, Pickle Finance charges a 0.2 performance fee from each harvest. As for OEC and Moonriver Jars, Pickle Finance charges a 0.1 performance fee. &#x20;

In most cases, only the reward token being harvested and compounded is applicable for these fees.&#x20;

Take, for example, the case of a Pickle Jar that requires a Sushi Liquidity Pool (sLP) token as its deposit. The sLP token represents partial ownership of a liquidity pool on Sushi Swap. If the Liquidity Pool itself returns 25% APR, and Sushi offers ‘Sushi’ reward tokens amounting to an additional 15%, only the Sushi reward tokens being sold and reinvested will have fees taken out. Pickle Finance will take no fees from the growth of that underlying pool.&#x20;

Some jars, however, do have custom fee schedules. All Yearn-partnered vaults (USDC, LUSD or FRAX) have different fees, amounting to a 20% performance fee plus a 2% AUM fee.
