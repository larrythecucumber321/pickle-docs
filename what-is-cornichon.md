# What is Cornichon?

After Pickle Finance was hit by the [Evil Jar Hack](https://github.com/banteg/evil-jar) costing users 19,759,355 DAI, the team created the [Cornichon token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa456b515303b2ce344e9d2601f91270f8c2fea5e) as a debt token in need of repayment. \


Today, 5% of all weekly revenues are allocated to buying back and burning this token at the current market price. Purchases are made against the DAI-CORNICHON liquidity pool on Uniswap. \
[This chart](https://duneanalytics.com/embeds/15984/32164/a03bdd45-9051-47b5-be80-26d91799bd40) shows how many tokens remain to be repurchased and burned.&#x20;
